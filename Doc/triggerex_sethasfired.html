<h1>SetHasFired</h1>
SetHasFired allows you to manually mark a trigger as fired for a player, or reset it.<p>

<pre>void SetHasFired(int playerId, int boolSet);</pre>

If boolSet is nonzero, the trigger will be marked as fired for the player specified in playerId, otherwise it will be cleared.<p>

<div class="tip">You can use this to force a victory or failure on a player. If you create a trigger attached to a victory or failure condition that is always true, but create it disabled, you can use this function to forcefully mark it as fired and cause the victory / failure condition to kick in.</div>
