<h1>HFL Basics</h1>
This page will introduce you to the basics of HFL and get you started in no time.

<h2>Configuring your compiler</h2>
Before you can start using HFL in your projects, you need to tell your compiler where the HFL headers and libraries are located.<br>
<b>Instructions for MS Visual C++ 5/6:</b><br>
Start the MSVC IDE. Go to Tools &gt; Options and click the Directories tab.
Make sure "Include files" is selected in the "Show directories for" dropdown. Double click the empty space and locate the "Include" directory within your HFL package.
Now choose "Library files" and do the same, this time with the "Lib" folder. Click OK to save your settings.<br>
<b>Instructions for MS Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 with CodeBlocks:</b><br>
Start CodeBlocks. Go to Settings &gt; Compiler and click the Directories tab.
Click the innermost Compiler tab and press the Add button, and locate your "Include" directory in your HFL package. Click OK in the Add dialog.
Now click the innermost Linker tab and push Add, this time locate the "Lib" folder. Click OK twice to save settings.

<h2>Starting a Project</h2>
Now that your compiler should be set up, start a typical OP2 mission project as you normally would. You'll get a standard file from the SDK, Main.cpp, with the standard chunks of code that make up an OP2 mission.
This should all be familiar to you (assuming you've written OP2 missions before).

<h2>Your first HFL mission</h2>
Go to main.cpp and scroll to the very top of the file. You'll see code that looks like this:
<pre>#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN		// Exclude rarely-used stuff from Windows headers
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

// Include important header files needed to interface with Outpost 2
#include "Outpost2DLL.h"
// Include header files to make it easier to build levels
#include "OP2Helper.h"

// ...</pre>

Below this area is where an extra #include statement will be added to give you access to the HFL library.
Below the #includes for Outpost2DLL.h and OP2Helper.h, add the following:
<pre>#include &lt;HFL.h&gt;</pre>
<p>This allows you to use the HFL functions and classes from your own code.</p>
<p>Next, you must add calls to HFLInit and HFLCleanup to initialize and cleanup the HFL library. Without these, HFL will not work at all.</p>
<h2>HFLInit & HFLCleanup Example</h2>
<p>Go to DllMain in your code. Inside, there may already be code to handle DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH and DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. Add code below so it looks like the following:</p>
<pre>
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include "HFL/Source/HFL.h"

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
	if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
	{
		DisableThreadLibraryCalls(hinstDLL);
		HFLInit();
	}
	else if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)
	{
		HFLCleanup();
	}

	return true;
}
</pre>
<p>Now that the calls are in place to initialize and cleanup HFL, we can begin using the library itself.</p>
<h2>Your first HFL function call</h2>
<p>HFL defines a new class, the UnitEx class. UnitEx stands for &quot;Unit Extension&quot; -- it can be used in place of any code that requires a plain old Unit.</p>
<p>We'll use this to create an RPG Lynx with the fire rate of a Tiger, by turning on the &quot;double fire rate&quot; flag that OP2 normally uses with Tigers to double their rate of fire. Use code such as the following:</p>
<pre>// Inside InitProc
UnitEx lynx; // a UnitEx var. It doesn't look that much different from a normal Unit var declaration.<br>
// Create a Lynx at (32, 32) for Player 0.. still not much different
TethysGame::CreateUnit(lynx, mapLynx, LOCATION(32+31, 32-1), 0, mapRPG, 0);

// Now, set the double fire rate flag
lynx.SetDoubleFireRate(1);</pre>
<p>Give the mission a suitable map, such as tutorial.map. Start the mission up and tell the RPG lynx to attack the ground. Its fire rate should be twice that of normal.</p>
<p>That's about it for the basics. Have a look at the rest of the manual for specifics on the different HFL functions.</p>
