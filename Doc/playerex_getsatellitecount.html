<h1>GetSatelliteCount</h1>
GetSatelliteCount will retrieve the number of 'satellites' of a specific type that the player has.<p>

<pre>int GetSatelliteCount(map_id objectType);</pre>

The game defines a 'satellite' to be anything up in space (with the exception of starship modules, these are handled differently in a way I'm not totally familiar with).<br>
This means there are three types of satellites possible:
<ul>
<li>mapRLV
<li>mapSolarSatellite
<li>mapEDWARDSatellite
</ul>
One of these three values can be passed to GetSatelliteCount to retrieve a count. If any other value is passed, GetSatelliteCount returns 0.
