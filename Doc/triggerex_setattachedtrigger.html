<h1>SetAttachedTrigger</h1>
For a victory condition, SetAttachedTrigger sets the trigger which is attached to the victory condition given a pointer to the trigger.

<pre>void SetAttachedTrigger(Trigger *trig);</pre>

Keep in mind that trig must be a pointer to a trigger:

<pre>// This code is the correct way.
TriggerEx vc;
Trigger trig;
// ...
vc.SetAttachedTrigger(&trig); // correct

// This is not correct and won't compile.
vc.SetAttachedTrigger(trig); // error</pre>
