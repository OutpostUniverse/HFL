<h1>SetDoubleFireRate</h1>
SetDoubleFireRate sets the value of the double fire rate flag for a combat unit.

<pre>void SetDoubleFireRate(int boolOn);</pre>

Tigers have the double fire rate flag set when they are created. The flag only causes the weapon turret to fire twice as fast (as if the unit had dual turrets).<br>
It does not mean that the unit will display dual-turret graphics.
