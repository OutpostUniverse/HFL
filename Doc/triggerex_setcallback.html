<h1>SetCallback</h1>
SetCallback sets the trigger callback function either by name or by function pointer. There are two possible function calls:<p>

<pre>void SetCallback(char *funcName);
void SetCallback(TRIGCB callback);</pre>

TRIGCB is typedef'd as a pointer to a trigger function. See GetCallbackAddress for more information.<p>

One possible use of SetCallback is to select a trigger function at random. For example, you could use one trigger to handle various types of disasters:

<pre>// It can be done through exported functions like so:
SCRIPT_API void Meteor()
{
	// meteor code..
}

SCRIPT_API void Lightning()
{
	// electrical storm code..
}

char *triggerNames[] = {"Meteor", "Lightning"};

TriggerEx trig;

void SetRandomDisaster()
{
	// assuming the trigger has already been created..
	trig.SetCallback(triggerNames[TethysGame::GetRand(2)]);
}

// The same is possible with function pointers, like so:
TRIGCB triggerPtrs[] = {Meteor, Lightning};

void SetRandomDisasterWithPointer()
{
	// assuming the trigger has already been created..
	trig.SetCallback(triggerPtrs[TethysGame::GetRand(2)]);
}

// ...

// Pointers have the added benefit of being able to be changed rather easily, for example if you wanted to have all meteors for awhile:
triggerPtrs[1] = Meteor;</pre>

If a function name is passed in (as a string), the game will immediately look up the function address for the name and save it. If the address is not found, the game will display a warning dialog.<br>
If a function pointer is passed in, it is saved immediately. No check is made to be sure that it points to valid memory.
