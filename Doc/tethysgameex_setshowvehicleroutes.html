<h1>SetShowVehicleRoutes</h1>
<p>SetShowVehicleRoutes turns on display of unit routes that the game has selected. It can be useful to find bottlenecks on a map during development.</p>
<pre>void SetShowVehicleRoutes(int boolOn);</pre>

<p class="warning">This function enables test code built into the game, it should be limited to debugging use only as it gives players a 'cheat' advantage (although it takes effect for all players). </p>
