<h1>IsAlliedTo</h1>
IsAlliedTo returns a true or false value indicating the state of an alliance between two players.<p>

<pre>int IsAlliedTo(int playerId);</pre>

A nonzero value is returned if the player is allied to the player given in the parameter. As an example:
<pre>if (ExtPlayer[0].IsAlliedTo(2))
{
	// Player 0 is allied to Player 2. This doesn't imply that player 2 is allied to player 0 however.
}</pre>

You can then use the AllyWith method from the normal _Player class to toggle the state of an alliance.<p>

<div class="warning">By default, players are allied to themselves as well as player 6 (the Gaia player).<br>
Undesired things may happen if either of these alliances are broken.</div>
