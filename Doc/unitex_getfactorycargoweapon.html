<h1>GetFactoryCargoWeapon</h1>
GetFactoryCargo returns the weapon / cargo value for an item in a factory bay.

<pre>map_id GetFactoryCargoWeapon(int bay);</pre>

bay is a number from 0-5 (0 = first bay in the factory). If an invalid bay number is used, -1 is returned.<br>
The weapon / cargo value for the item is returned (for example, if a Rail Gun Guard Post is in bay 0, mapRailGun would get returned if bay 0 were queried).<p>

The result is undefined if the bay doesn't contain an item in the first place.
