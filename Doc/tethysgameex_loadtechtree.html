<h1>LoadTechtree</h1>
<p>LoadTechtree loads a different techtree after the mission has started. </p>
<pre>void LoadTechtree(char *fileName, int maxTechLevel);</pre>

<p>fileName specifies the name of the techtree file to load. maxTechLevel specifies the maximum tech level to load (the first two digits of a Tech ID are the tech level), technologies with a higher tech level than this are skipped.</p>
<p class="warning">The file that is loaded must not contain errors. If it does, the game state may be unstable.<br>
  Also, the result is undefined if labs are currently researching anything when the techtree is loaded. </p>
