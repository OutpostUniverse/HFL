<h1>GetCargoAmount</h1>
GetCargoAmount returns the current amount of cargo held in a Cargo Truck.

<pre>int GetCargoAmount();</pre>

The maximum possible amount of cargo a truck can carry is 4095.<br>
For wreckage, internally the "cargo amount" (or tech ID) has 8000 subtracted from it. Therefore, this means that the tech ID of a wreck must be in the range of 8000-12095.<br>
You can use the SetTruckCargo function from the standard Unit class to set the amount of cargo in a truck.<br>
You can use the GetCargoType function to get the type of cargo held in a truck.
