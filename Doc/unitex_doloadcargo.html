<h1>DoLoadCargo</h1>
DoLoadCargo fills a Cargo Truck with materials from a structure with a dock.

<pre>void DoLoadCargo();</pre>

The truck should be empty before DoLoadCargo is called. Also, this function does not work with structures that can't load cargo into a truck directly.<br>
For factories with storage bays, use DoTransferCargo instead. The vehicle must be sitting on the dock before this function is called.
