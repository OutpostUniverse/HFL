<h1>ProcessCommandPacket</h1>
ProcessCommandPacket injects a game command packet directly into the game engine locally to be processed. (The packet will not get sent over the network).

<pre>int ProcessCommandPacket(CommandPacket *packet);</pre>

No error checking or input validation is performed on the packet. The result from the game engine is returned (typically a true or false value).<p>

<div class="warning">This function is intended only for those familiar and comfortable with using CommandPackets directly.<br>
Unwanted behavior will almost certainly result if invalid data is passed.</div>
