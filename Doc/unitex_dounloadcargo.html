<h1>DoUnloadCargo</h1>
DoUnloadCargo empties the contents of a Cargo Truck into the structure which with it is docked.

<pre>void DoUnloadCargo();</pre>

The truck should have some contents to empty before this function is called. It must be sitting on a dock of a structure that can accept cargo.<br>
For factories with bays, use DoTransferCargo instead.
