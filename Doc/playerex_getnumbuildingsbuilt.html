<h1>GetNumBuildingsBuilt</h1>
GetNumBuildingsBuilt returns the number of buildings constructed by the player.<p>

<pre>int GetNumBuildingsBuilt();</pre>

GetNumBuildingsBuilt can be used to control AI and other tasks, for example after the player has 10 buildings the AI will start attacking:

<pre>if (ExtPlayer[0].GetNumBuildingsBuilt() >= 10)
{
	// start the attacks from the AI base here... :-)
}</pre>
