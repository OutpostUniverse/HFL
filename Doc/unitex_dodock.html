<h1>DoDock</h1>
DoDock will cause a unit with docking abilities to move to the dock located at dockLocation and dock with it.

<pre>void DoDock(LOCATION dockLocation);</pre>

To dock with a Garage, use DoDockAtGarage instead.<br>
You should make sure the vehicle is on the structure's dock before other commands that manipulate the dock and cargo are used.
