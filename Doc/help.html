<h1>Getting Help </h1>
<p>If you are having a problem with HFL, let me know by email, forum PM, or on IRC. I'll try to help you out the best I can. If you have a bug to report, see the FAQ for details on reporting bugs.</p>
<p>You might also try to ask in the programming section of the forum -- get as many people as possible to think about how a problem could be solved. </p>
