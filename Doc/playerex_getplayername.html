<h1>GetPlayerName</h1>
GetPlayerName retrieves the text name of the player, useful in multiplayer missions to generate messages customized for each player.

<pre>char* GetPlayerName();</pre>

The pointer to the buffer that GetPlayerName returns is a global buffer. If you need to save the name for any length of time, you should make a copy of it using strcpy or other means, as the next call to GetPlayerName (including calls made internally by the game) will overwrite its contents.

<pre>char playerName[15];
strcpy(playerName, ExtPlayer[0].GetPlayerName());
// You are now safe to use the playerName variable, as a copy has been made in your mission.</pre>
