<h1>DoPoof</h1>
DoPoof causes a unit to disappear, or 'poof' from the map immediately.

<pre>void DoPoof();</pre>

DoPoof will cause a minor graphics glitch. (The unit graphics will not disappear until the map viewport is moved). It is best to take the unit to the edge of the map before poofing it.
