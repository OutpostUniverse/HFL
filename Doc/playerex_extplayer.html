<h1>ExtPlayer</h1>
ExtPlayer is a new array that allows the use of PlayerEx in place of Player in mission scripting.<br>
Use is similar to the Player array, as an example:

<pre>int playerColor = ExtPlayer[0].GetColorNumber();</pre>

You must use the ExtPlayer array in order to use the new methods that PlayerEx provides. The following will generate an error.

<pre>int playerColor = Player[0].GetColorNumber(); // error</pre>
