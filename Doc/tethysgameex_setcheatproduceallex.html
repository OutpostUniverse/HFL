<h1>SetCheatProduceAllEx</h1>
<p>SetCheatProduceAllEx enables players to produce units they can't normally produce (either due to technology or race). It is a replacement for SetCheatProduceAll. </p>
<pre>void SetCheatProduceAllEx(int boolOn);</pre>

<p class="warning">This function enables test code built into the game, it should be limited to debugging use only as it gives players a 'cheat' advantage (although it takes effect for all players). </p>
