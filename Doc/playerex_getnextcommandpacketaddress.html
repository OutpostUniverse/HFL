<h1>GetNextCommandPacketAddress</h1>
GetNextCommandPacketAddress returns a pointer to the next command packet in the queue ready to be processed by the game.

<pre>CommandPacket* GetNextCommandPacketAddress();</pre>

The pointer returned points to a buffer inside the game. You can modify the contents of the buffer in order to change or prevent player commands from being processed.<br>
For example, the following code cancels the next player command about to be processed:

<pre>CommandPacket *packet = ExtPlayer[0].GetNextCommandPacketAddress(); // Get the next command

packet->type = ctNop; // Cancel the command</pre>

If called from AIProc or a trigger callback function, this will affect packets before they are sent for processing to the engine (but packets modified here will not get sent through the network).<br>
Packet and unit processing is done after triggers and AIProc are called.<p>

<div class="warning">GetNextCommandPacketAddress is a function for advanced users only. Incorrect use may prevent player commands from being received, or general game instability.</div>
